    This repository contains the code for a friendly virtual assistant that can provide basic information and greetings.

        <li>**Install Dependencies:**
            <pre>
(Replace `python` with your programming language if different)

cd Friendly-Assistant
pip install <list-of-required-libraries>  # Example: pip install datetime random requests
            </pre>
        </li>

Good evening! 

Let me know who you'd like to learn about. (Enter a name)
